        <p>The MRI 1.9 on Windows series has well known performance regressions and has for
        some time. This project's goal is to find and fix the issues, and get the fixes
        committed back into mainstream MRI.</p>
        <p>It's like watching your old reliable Honda develop transmission problems and
        struggle to get over 45 MPH. Rather than retiring it to the shredder, folks have
        pulled it into The Code Shop for repairs.</p>
